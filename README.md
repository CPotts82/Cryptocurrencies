# Cryptocurrencies
## Objective
Accountability Accounting is an investment firm that would like to offer cryptocurrency investment portfolios to clients interested in investing in the cryptocurrency market.  However, the cryptocurrency realm is overwhelming and the investment firm needs assistance developing the potential portfolios.  Accountability Accounting has asked for a report to show what cryptocurrencies are currently trading on the market and how the differenct currencies could possibly be grouped for these investment portfolios. 

This analysis used unsupervised machine learning due to not knowing the potential grouping outcomes. The K-means clustering algorithm was used to help identify possible ways to classify cryptocurrencies. 

## Resources:

## Findings
There are a total of 533 tradable cryptocurrencies currently on the market. 
The K-means clustering algorithm identified that there are potentially 4 different 'clusters' or classifications for the currently trading cryptocurrencies. Of the four classes there is one class that the majority of the cryptocurrencies have been grouped in. There is another class that has considerably less cryptocurrency and the final two classes are both comprised of just 1 cryptocurrency each. Using the data contained in the report along with visual explanations of the data, Accountability Accounting can now move forward with creating the crypocurrency portfolios to offer.
